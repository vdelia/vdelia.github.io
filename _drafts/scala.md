Why Scala?  Because some of the most remarkable open source projects of the last years, like [Akka][akka] and [Spark][spark], are written in scala.
 It has a big community (which keeps growing), and a lot of hype. Simply stated: if you are interested in distributed systems you cannot ignore Scala.

These are my notes on Scala.

## Install

You need a JDK installed. I assume you have it.

There is only one right way to be up and running, which works on every platform. It is **SBT**.

Don't download anything, ignore your package manager and just to the [leiningen][lein] website.


### SBT

### IntelliJ

[akka]: http://akka.io
[spark]: https://spark.apache.org
