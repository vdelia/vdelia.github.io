[Julia][julia] is a high level programming language designed for technical computing.

Random interesting features (language + ecosystem):
*    designed to be fast
*    syntax similar to python/ruby
*    dynamic typing
*    parametric types
*    *multiple dispatch* and *syntactic macros* (Cf. [Common Lisp][cl])
*    designed for parallelism
*    built in package manager
*    it has a [backend for ipython/jupyter][ijulia]
*    great interoperability to C/Fortran/Python/...
*    great lib for [vector graphics][compose]
*    you can create/run/share your notebooks online on [JuliaBox][juliabox].
     When you sign on it, you get some interactive tutorials.


This post contains a possible solution to the [problem 7 of project Euler][euler7].

# Hello, Julia!

You can find command line tools on the julia [download page][command_line]. If
you prefer in IDE, check [Juno][juno].
The fastest way to collaborate and experimenting is [JuliaBox][juliabox].
